In this we have implemented Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Linear Search, Binary Search for searching and sorting algorithms
Aslo for graphs we used topological sort, Dijkstra algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. 

also for executing the graph algorithm we have removed the cycle using the greedy approach by using reculsive without any data loss and was able to find reasonable insights in the data we where given
